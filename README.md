![Iris Flower](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/41/Iris_versicolor_3.jpg)

## 🔍 Project Overview

This project uses **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** along with other machine learning algorithms to classify the famous **Iris dataset** into three species:  
- *Iris-setosa*  
- *Iris-versicolor*  
- *Iris-virginica*

We compare SVM with **Random Forest** and **MLP (Neural Network)** to evaluate performance. This project is ideal for those beginning with supervised machine learning.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Understand and visualize the Iris dataset.
- Apply SVM, Random Forest, and MLP classifiers.
- Evaluate and compare their accuracy and performance.
- Display results using charts, confusion matrices, and classification reports.

This project focuses on classifying iris flowers into three species — Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica — using supervised machine learning models. We use the classic Iris dataset, which contains 150 samples with four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

🔍 Goals
To compare the performance of multiple machine learning models including:

Random Forest

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)

✅ Key Steps
Loaded and explored the Iris dataset.

Preprocessed data by encoding labels and standardizing features.

Split the dataset into training and test sets.

Trained models using Random Forest, SVM (with linear kernel), and MLP.

Evaluated each model using accuracy, classification reports, and confusion matrices.

Performed 5-fold cross-validation to assess model stability.

📈 Results
SVM achieved 96.67% accuracy on the test set and 98% average accuracy in cross-validation.

Random Forest and MLP both achieved 100% accuracy on the test set.

All models showed excellent classification performance, with SVM being a strong and efficient choice due to its robustness and generalization power.

📊 Visualization
The project includes visualizations like:

Model accuracy comparison bar chart

Confusion matrices for each classifier
